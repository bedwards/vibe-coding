# Vibe Coding

**One Human, One AI, One Industry Disrupted**

By Brian Edwards | November 2025

---

A radical, opinionated guide to AI-driven software development. This is not a gentle introduction—it is a field report from the trenches documenting what happens when one developer stops treating AI as autocomplete and starts treating it as a genuine collaborator.

- The workflow in practice
- Automated verification and guardrails
- Git workflow and branch strategy
- When Claude gets stuck
- The human role
- Parallel operations with multiple AI agents

**Part Three: The Economics and Ethics**
- What software costs now
- Why open source, why now
- The disruption of software teams
- The path forward

**Part Four: The Practice**
- Detailed setup guides for environment, CI/CD, security
- Working with Claude: practical patterns
- Bot accounts and multi-instance coordination
- Database migrations, monitoring, and operations

## The Evidence

This methodology was developed building [Care Commons](https://github.com/neighborhood-lab/care-commons), an open-source home healthcare management platform. The project includes:

- Multi-tenant SaaS with HIPAA compliance
- Electronic Visit Verification (EVV) per 21st Century Cures Act
- State-specific regulatory configurations (TX, FL, and more)
- React web application, React Native mobile app
- Comprehensive test coverage and CI/CD

Built by one developer with AI assistance over several months—work that would traditionally require a team of 10-15 engineers over 12-18 months.
