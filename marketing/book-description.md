# Vibe Coding - Book Description

## Short Description (100 words)

A radical guide to AI-driven software development from a developer who built production healthcare software with one human and one AI. This isn't theory—it's a field report documenting how Claude and modern tooling enabled one engineer to accomplish in weeks what traditionally requires teams of 10+ developers working for a year. Covers methodology, tooling, workflow, economics, and the uncomfortable implications for the software industry. Based on real experience at Atlassian, Zenoss, and building Care Commons.

## Medium Description (250 words)

The conventional wisdom says AI tools are helpful assistants that speed up certain coding tasks. This book argues that view is profoundly wrong.

"Vibe Coding" documents what happens when a developer stops treating AI as autocomplete and starts treating it as a genuine collaborator. The result: production healthcare software built by one human with AI assistance—work that would traditionally require a team of 10-15 engineers working for 12-18 months.

Brian Edwards draws on experience at Atlassian (Bitbucket team) and Zenoss to contrast traditional software engineering with this new methodology. The book covers:

- Why traditional development practices evolved and why they no longer fully apply
- A specific, opinionated workflow for human-AI collaboration
- Detailed environment setup, CI/CD configuration, and operational practices
- The economics of software becoming nearly free to produce
- Uncomfortable implications for software teams and the industry

This is not a balanced overview. It's an argument for a specific methodology, grounded in evidence from a real project (Care Commons, open-source home healthcare software). The recommendations are opinionated and the implications are uncomfortable.
